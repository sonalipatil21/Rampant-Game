# Rampant-Game
Our project aims to fill the “fun and free” void created by the pay-to-win race that has been ramping up in the past few years. The customer requests a game that includes a player controlled person that moves around and fires upon enemies that try to kill the player. The player will take damage if they come in contact with an enemy unit. It is the player’s mission to take out the enemies on the screen with his or her projectile launching weapon. The player can buy power-ups with scored points. Scored points will be earned for each enemy unit killed. If the player takes a considerable amount of damage during the mission, the player will run out of lives and die. Once the player had died then the mission will be over and the player can play again.
